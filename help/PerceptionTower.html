  <h1>Perception Tower</h1>

  In the triple-tower architecture, the perception tower consists of a
  set of rules to derive higher-level and more complex predicates from
  the primitive predicates.

  <p>
  Primitive predicates are the properties that can be directly
  observed from the environment. In the case of the TRTower, the
  primitive predicates are On(x, y) and Holding(z). Using these two
  predicates, the Perception Tower derives: Clear(), Ordered(), and
  Tower().
