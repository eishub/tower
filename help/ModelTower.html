  <h1>Model Tower</h1>

  The Model Tower stores the predicate values computed by the
  Perception Tower. Note that the Perception also reads from the Model
  Tower the lower-level predicates in deriving the higher-level ones.

  <p>
  These predicate values are then used as inputs to the Action Tower
  when the teleo-reactive sequences are evaluated.
