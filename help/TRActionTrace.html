  <h1>TR Action Trace</h1>

  A teleo-reactive (TR) sequence can recursively call itself, or other
  sequence. Therefore, the TR Action Trace displays the order in which
  the TR sequences are called (along with the parameters passed to
  them). 

  <p>
  Note that in contrary to traditional function programming, a callee
  sequence's execution is contingent upon its caller is still
  active. That is, when a parent is deactivated, its chain of children
  sequences will also be deactivated.
