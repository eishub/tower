    <h1>Environment</h1>
    
    Environment is everything that are observed or affected by the
    teleo-reactive program.

    <p>
    In the case of TRTower, the environment consists of a robot arm,
    and blocks that can be stacked on another one, or on the table.

    </p><p>
    The user can directly interact with the system by clicking on a
    block to drag and reposition it.
