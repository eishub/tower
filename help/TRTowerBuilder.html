  <h1>TR Tower Builder</h1>

  <h2>TRTower</h2> 

  The TRTower program provides an animation to illustrate the behavior
  of a robotic system controlled by teleo-reactive (TR) sequences
  using the triple-tower (Perception, Action, and Model Tower)
  architecture.

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <ul>

  <li>Press "New Block" to create blocks.  

  </li><li>Enter the block ID(s) in the textfield(s) and click on the
  corresponding action button (e.g., "move-to-table", "unpile") to
  initiate the TR sequence.

  </li><li>The "maketower" TR sequence takes a list of block IDs as
  parameters; they are entered as a space-separated list.

  </li><li>Click and drag to reposition a block.

  </li><li>The "step" button will run the initiated TR sequence until a
  primitive predicate changes, then the animation will be paused.

  </li><li>Click on the heading labels (highlighted in blue when the cursor
  rolls over) to access online help. Online help is displayed in a
  web browser window when the program is run as an applet, and in a
  built-in help browser window when run as an application. To override
  to display help in built-in browser, click on heading label while
  holding down the shift key.
