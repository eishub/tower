  <h1>Durative Action</h1>
  A durative action is an action that once initiated, it will be
  executed continuously. 

  <p>
  The TRTower has three basic durative actions: pickup(x), putdown(x,
  y), and nil().

  </p><ul>
  <li>Pickup(x) picks up block x. The block is only considered picked
  up when the claw has closed completely. If the robot arm is already
  holding block x, then it does nothing.

  </li><li>Putdown(x, y) puts down block x on block y, or, if y is the
  table id (TA), then x is put down on the table. The block is
  considered put down once the claw opens up. If the robot arm is not
  holding block x, or the destination block y is not clear (e.g.,
  beneath another block or being held), then the robot arm will not
  move, but generates an error message (displayed in the bottom right
  "Durative Action Status" panel).

  </li><li>Nil() simply returns the robot arm to its home position (top
  left corner). If the robot arm is holding a block, the block will
  also be carried along to the home position.
  
  </li></ul>

  <p>
  The higher-level actions (e.g., maketower, move-to-table) are
  achieved using these three basic durative actions.
